## Steps to use 

1. Go to your linkedin post and load all comments
2. Open your browser's web development tools and paste this on the console.
3. Replace the reply message with your own
4. Run:
  * reply() to reply the current comment (highlighted in yellow)
  * next() to skip that comment
  * autoreply() to reply all automatically (it takes about 15 seconds to reply to each comment, but you can adjust the period variable if you want to try to do it faster - some replies could fail to post)


Use at your own risk. There's no warranty linkedin will not block you if you abuse this tool
